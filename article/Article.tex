% scope of the document.
Pruning and debarbing are common operations used for cleaning up
skeletons of complex shapes in preparation for other processing. ITK
has no debarbing filter and its pruning filter is wrong and limited to
2D. This article presents a brief background to pruning and debarbing
and introduces filters to carry out these operations.

\section{Introduction}
Skeletons are essentially the centre lines of shapes and are often
used as part of an object characterisation process, for example the
length of a curving, linear object could be estimated using the length
of the skeleton. In general a skeleton is produced by finding ridge
lines in a distance transform using a queue based erosion or some sort
of fast marching approach. However the skeletons produced from real
data generally have a number of artifacts in the form of barbs that
result from small imperfections in the edge of the mask from which the
skeleton is produced. Such barbs are often undesirable and can be
removed using pruning and debarbing steps.

\section{Pruning}
Pruning can be thought of as an erosion of a skeleton, with each
branch of the skeleton being reduced in length by a defined number of
voxels. A loop in a skeleton will never be eliminated by pruning
because there are no endpoints.

\section{Debarbing}
Debarbing is a morphological opening of a skeleton, in which barbs
that are less than the defined length are removed and all others
remain the same.

\section{itkBinaryPruningImageFilter}
The pruning implementation currently in ITK is limited and wrong, in
that it a single iteration can remove an entire skeleton if the
skeleton is oriented such that successive elements of a branch are
visited in raster order. In addition, it doesn't support different
types of connectivity, assumes that skeleton values are 1, is limited
to 2 dimensions. The fundamental problem with the algorithm is that it
attempts to operate in place on the output image.

This fault is demonstrated using test??

In addition it visits every voxel in an image every iteration, wihch
is very inefficient, especially when dealing with long barbs.
